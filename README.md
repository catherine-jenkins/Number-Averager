# Number-Averager (Java)

This is a Java program that determines the smallest, largest, and average value from 10 given integers. The user is prompted to enter ten integers between 1 and 100, and then the results are given. The program runs as follows:


Step 1: Prompt the user to input ten integers between 1 and 100, and initilaize a for-loop with 10 iterations.


Step 2: As the user enters each new integer, compare it to smallestValue (initialized at 100) and the largestValue (initialized at 0). If the value is smaller than smallestValue, it should replace smallestValue. If the value is larger than largestValue, it should replace largestValue. 


Step 3: At the end of each iteration, the user's input should be added to runningTotal

Step 4: Once all ten integers have been entered and correctly assigned, the program shoud exit the for-loop and divide the runningTotal by 10.0 to compute the average. 

Step 5: The computer should display the smallest value, largest value, and the average.
